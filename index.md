I'm a MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it){:target="_blank"}. My studies are focused mainly on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with a major on Deep Learning and a minor on Robotics. Previously I was a BSc student in Computer Engineering at the same university and even before I got High School Diploma on Computer Science.
