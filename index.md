I live in small town called Melzo near Milan and I am a MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it){:target="_blank"}. My studies are mainly focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with a major on Deep Learning and a minor on Robotics.

I have plenty of hobbies (really... too many to be listed): from Martial Arts, going through TV series until travelling, but what I mostly do is studying. Well not just engineering (mmh...), I am constantly up-to-date on what happens around the world, politically and environmentally. 
The reason why I love studying AI is becase I deeply dislike the society and I think through these technologies is possible to pursue equality and real freedom.
